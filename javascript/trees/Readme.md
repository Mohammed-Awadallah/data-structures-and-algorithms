# Trees
> _Tree is a data structure that uses nodes to simulate hierarchical data. Nodes store data and point to other nodes (each node stores its own data and pointers to other nodes)_

## Challenge
### Features 
* Node 
    - Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node
* Binary trees
    - Create a Binary Tree class
    - Define a method for each of the depth first traversals:    
        - pre order
        - in orde
        - post order which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.


## Approach & Efficiency
### BinaryTree
- preOrder: space O(n)/time O(n)
- inOrder: space O(n)/time O(n)
- postOrder: space O(n)/time O(n)
- getMax: space O(n)/time O(n)
- breadth: space O(n)/time O(n)
### BinarySearchTree
- add: space O(1)/time O(n)
- contains: space O(1)/time O(n)
