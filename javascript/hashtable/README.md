 # Hashtables

        Hash table is one of the most important data structures in computing. A hash table (hash map) is a data structure used to implement an associative array, a structure that can map keys to values. A hash table uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. In JavaScript we donâ€™t have any built-in hash table.

        While many programming languages support associative arrays (hash tables or arrays with named indexes, JavaScript does not. In JavaScript arrays use numbered indexes.
 
 ## Challenge         
            Implement a Hashtable Class with the following methods:
            set
            Arguments: key, value
            Returns: nothing
            This method should hash the key, and set the key and value pair in the table, handling collisions as needed.
            Should a given key already exist, replace its value from the value argument given to this method.
            get
            Arguments: key
            Returns: Value associated with that key in the table
            contains
            Arguments: key
            Returns: Boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.
            keys
            Returns: Collection of keys
            hash
            Arguments: key
            Returns: Index in the collection for that key


## BIG O
set: space O(1)/time O(1)
hash: space O(1)/time O(1)
contains: space O(1)/time O(1) - time O(n) if there is a collision
get: space O(1)/time O(1) - time O(n) if there is a collision
