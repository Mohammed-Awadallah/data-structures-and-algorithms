# Singly Linked List

A linked list is a sequence of data structures, which are connected together via links. Linked List is a sequence of links which contains items. Each link contains a connection to another link. Linked list is the second most-used data structure after array.

  

## Challenge

### Node

* Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.

### Linked List

 - create linked list class
 - create append method
 - create insertBefore method
 - create insertAfter method
 - create includes method
 - create insert method
 - create toString method
 - create kthFromEnd method
 - created zippedList function
 - created isPalindrome function

## Approach & Efficiency

### Big O 

- append has
   * time : O(n)
   * space : O(1)
- insert has
   * time : O(n)
   * space : O(1)
- insertBefore has
   * time : O(n)
   * space : O(1)
- insertAfter has
   * time : O(n)
   * space : O(1)
- toString has
   * time : O(n)
   * space : O(1)
- includes has
   * time : O(n)
   * space : O(1)
- kthFromEnd has
   * time : O(n)
   * space : O(1)
- zipLists has
   * time : O(n)
   * space : O(n)
-isPalindrome has
   * time : O(n)
   * space : O(1)
