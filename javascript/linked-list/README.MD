## Challenge

### Node

* Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.

### Linked List

 - create linked list class
 - create append method
 - create insertBefore method
 - create insertAfter method
 - create includes method
 - create insert method
 - create toString method

  

## Approach & Efficiency

### Big O 

 1. Append has O(_1_) since i used tail pointer
 2. insertBefore has O(_n_) because of while loop
 3. insertAfter has O(_n_) because of while loop
 4. includes has   O(_n_) because of while loop
 5. insert has O(_1_) because of no loop
 6. toString has O(_n_) because of while loop
