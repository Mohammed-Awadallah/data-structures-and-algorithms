# Insertion Sort 

>Insertion Sort is one of the simpler sorting algorithms. It's highly intuitive, stable, in-place, and of comparison-type.
Despite being pretty time-consuming with quadratic complexity, it is very useful when the input array is small in size.


## Challenge 
- Write a blog post stepping through the insertion sort algorithm
- Code a working, tested implementation of insertion sort based on the provided pseudocode that takes in an array and returns the same array sorted.

## Approach & Efficiency

* Time: O(n^2)

        - The basic operation of this algorithm is comparison. This will happen n * (n-1) number of times…concluding the algorithm to be n squared.

* Space: O(1)

        - No additional space is being created. This array is being sorted in place…keeping the space at constant O(1).
